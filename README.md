# Sezzle Calculator

## Usage
Apart from obvious controls, you can click on Sezzle logo to reset the input.
I did not like the idea of creating extra button for that as my layout is full,
but I admit this approach is not very intuitive.

## Known limitations
There are some things I did not have time to complete 100%,
but I tried to cover at least a selection of every aspect of the app.

Things I would improve in production app/given more time:
* unit tests
* button validations (to prevent user from inputting invalid expression)
* better user-facing validations
* make input field writable and allow free-typing (I would love it as user but seems excessive for this demo)
* brackets support (were not mentioned in specification, and I did not have time for this 'extra' feature)
* environment variables for backend host, etc

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
